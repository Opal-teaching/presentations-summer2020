# Summer 2020 Bootcamp

## Material to Cover

Below, you'll find a list of all of the material covered during the summer 2020 Opal bootcamp. Each item below doesn't need to be 
followed in a specific order, except for the assignments which are ordered and sometimes should be done after a specific presentation 
(this will be mentioned). Links to tutorials are included for each language or framework, but you can use other resources 
if you prefer.

An overview of what to expect during this bootcamp is available [here](./overview.md).

* Asynchronous Javascript & Promises (Presentation #3, [article on asynchronous JS](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/exactly-makes-javascript-weird-programming-language/), [article on callbacks](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/introduction-to-asynchronous-javascript))

* AngularJS (*note*: make sure to study AngularJS (i.e. Angular 1), not Angular 2 or higher) ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp), [JohnPapa Style Guide (**important**)](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md))
