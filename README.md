# Summer 2020 Bootcamp

## Material to Cover

Below, you'll find a list of all of the material covered during the summer 2020 Opal bootcamp. Each item below doesn't need to be 
followed in a specific order, except for the assignments which are ordered and sometimes should be done after a specific presentation 
(this will be mentioned). Links to tutorials are included for each language or framework, but you can use other resources 
if you prefer.

### Languages and Frameworks

Follow a complete tutorial for all languages and frameworks listed below, either to learn them for the first time or as a refresher. 
Skip any language that you're already fully comfortable with.

* Javascript ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript))

* Asynchronous Javascript & Promises (Presentation #3, [article on asynchronous JS](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/exactly-makes-javascript-weird-programming-language/), [article on callbacks](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/introduction-to-asynchronous-javascript))

* AngularJS (*note*: make sure to study AngularJS (i.e. Angular 1), not Angular 2 or higher) ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp), [JohnPapa Style Guide (**important**)](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md))

* Git ([Interactive tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/), [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/index.htm), [Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123))

* Beginner's HTML and CSS ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/))

* Beginner's SQL ([SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/))

* Node.js (if you know Javascript, you'll be able to use Node.js, but you can look at the [Node.js Guides](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/) if you want to learn more)

### Assignments

Complete the following assignments, made by David Herrera in summer 2018. These assignments are meant to help you try out the concepts 
introduced in the presentations. There is no right answer for each of these excercises, and your solutions won't be turned in. You may 
need to do some online searching on your own to find ways to make everything work.

* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/Opal-teaching/messaging-app) ("Hello World the Opal Way", in the repository "messaging-app"): This assignment will teach you about the fundamentals of the Opal app frontend setup. Don't complete the whole messaging app right away, just start with "Hello World the Opal Way".

* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/Opal-teaching/async_js_assignment) (in repository "async_js_assignment"): To do after the presentation on asynchronous JavaScript and Promises.

* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/Opal-teaching/firebase-simple-app) (in repository "firebase-simple-app"): To do after the presentation on AngularJS filters and Firebase.

* [Assignment 4](https://github.com/Opal-teaching/messaging-app) (in repository "messaging-app"): The last assignment of bootcamp. This one can be started at any time, but you'll be best equiped to do it after presentation #4 on AngularJS filters and Firebase.

### Presentations

All presentations given during this bootcamp are available in this repository. Refer back to them when needed.
