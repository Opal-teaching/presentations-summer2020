At the end of the presentations and assignments, you'll be given instructions on installing a development environment for Opal,
after which you'll be given one last assignment: fixing a bug in Opal.

Finally, we may also have additional presentations on All-in-One and Questionnaires.

## Tentative Schedule (3 weeks)

The goal is to get most of the presentations and the first few assignments done in week 1.
Week 2 will be used to finish the presentations and do the last few assignments.
We'll do the Opal installation and bug-fixing assignment in week 3.
